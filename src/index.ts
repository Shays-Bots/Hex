 * Semicolons are a legacy artifact:
 * - Completely useless unless adding multiple instructions per line
 * - Completely optional in JavaScript/Typescript.
 * - Just adds useless clutter to the text
 *
 * You don't have to change habbit:
 * eslint format-on-save automatically removes semicolons for you.
 *
 * Embrace change, don't get stuck in the past.
